This document defines **how to initialize** the file-based issue tracking system. For detailed workflow documentation, see [do-work.prompt.md]({{ prompt_path }}/do-work.prompt.md).

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Baseline is the quality floor** – nothing may regress
2. **One active issue at a time**
3. **Shortlist has highest priority** – user intent overrides all
4. **All regressions block completion**
5. **Issues are the only unit of work**
6. **History is immutable**
7. **Every issue must be uniquely identifiable**

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

When `init work` is triggered, create this structure:

```
.work/
├── baseline.md               # Quality metrics snapshot (generated separately)
└── agent/
    ├── focus.md              # Current execution state (Previous/Current/Next)
    ├── memory.md             # Persistent cross-session knowledge
    ├── notes/                # Scratchpad, research, working notes
    │   └── .gitkeep
    └── issues/
        ├── critical.md       # P0 – blockers, security, data loss
        ├── high.md           # P1 – broken core functionality
        ├── medium.md         # P2 – enhancements, tech debt
        ├── low.md            # P3 – minor improvements
        ├── backlog.md        # Untriaged ideas
        ├── shortlist.md      # USER-DIRECTED priorities (highest priority)
        ├── history.md        # Completed / closed issues (append-only)
        └── references/       # Specs, logs, large docs, research
            └── .gitkeep
```

### Structural Rules

- Issues exist **only** in `.work/agent/issues/`
- `history.md` is **append-only**
- `shortlist.md` is **read-only for agents** unless user explicitly instructs changes
- `.work/` is the single source of operational truth

## 🆔 Issue Identity Format

Every issue **MUST** have a canonical identifier:

```
<PREFIX>-<NUMBER>@<HASH>
```

**Example:** `BUG-003@a9f3c2`

### Rules

- `<PREFIX>-<NUMBER>`: Human-readable, sequential within prefix
- `<HASH>`: Exactly 6 lowercase hex characters, generated once, immutable

### Issue ID Prefixes

| Prefix   | Meaning                     |
|----------|----------------------------|
| BUG      | Defect                      |
| FEAT     | New feature                 |
| ENHANCE  | Improve existing behavior   |
| REFACTOR | Structural/code improvement |
| DOCS     | Documentation               |
| TEST     | Testing                     |
| SEC      | Security                    |
| PERF     | Performance                 |
| DEBT     | Technical debt              |
| STRUCT   | Architectural issue         |

---

## 📝 Issue Schema

All issues **MUST** use this template:

```markdown
---
id: "<PREFIX>-<NUMBER>@<HASH>"
title: "Concise, specific title"
description: "One-sentence summary"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
section: "<area of codebase>"
tags: [tag1, tag2]

| high.md      | P1       | Core functionality broken            |

## ⚠️ After `init work`

After creating the structure:

1. ⚠️ **Generate baseline before any code changes**
   ```
   generate-baseline
   ```

2. Review detected project context in `memory.md`

3. Ready for work via `continue` or `focus on <topic>`

---

## 🤖 Configuring AGENTS.md

To enable agents to use the workflow system, add a reference to `do-work.prompt.md` in your agent configuration file.

### Template Variables

This prompt system uses Jinja2 templates. The following variables are resolved at runtime:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `.github/prompts` | Path to prompt files | `.github/prompts`, `.work/prompts` |
| `copilot` | Current AI tool name | `copilot`, `claude`, `cursor` |
| `` | Project root directory | `/home/user/myproject` |

### AI Tool Prompt Locations

Different AI tools expect prompts in different locations:

| AI Tool | Configuration Location |
|---------|------------------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `.github/prompts/` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` in project root, or `.claude/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |
| Aider | `.aider/` or conventions file |
| Tool-agnostic | `.work/prompts/` |

### Adding the Reference

Add the following to your agent configuration, using the template variable:

```markdown
## Workflow

When working on issues or tasks, follow the workflow defined in:

- [do-work.prompt.md]({{ prompt_path }}/do-work.prompt.md)

Key commands:
- `init work` – Initialize the issue tracking system
- `continue` – Resume work following the optimal iteration loop
- `focus on <topic>` – Create prioritized issues for a specific topic
```

### Copying Prompt Files

Copy the prompt files to your project's prompt directory:

```
.github/prompts/
├── do-work.prompt.md              # Workflow documentation
└── setup-issue-tracker.prompt.md  # This setup guide
```

### Minimal Agent Configuration Example

```markdown
# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
<your project description>

## Workflow

This project uses file-based issue tracking. Follow the workflow in:
- [do-work.prompt.md]({{ prompt_path }}/do-work.prompt.md)

Before making any code changes:
1. Run `init work` if `.work/` doesn't exist
2. Run `generate-baseline` before any code changes
3. Use `continue` to start/resume work

## Code Standards
<your coding standards>
