# Global default frontmatter for skills.
#
# This file provides default YAML frontmatter values that are merged with each
# skill's frontmatter at runtime. Local values in individual skill files
# override these global defaults (deep merge).
#
# If this file is missing, the parser falls back to requiring all frontmatter
# in individual skill files (backward compatible).

defaults:
  # Default environment configurations shared across all skills.
  # Individual skills can override these by redefining specific environments
  # in their own frontmatter.
  #
  # Note: Currently only Claude Code supports native skills. Other environments
  # may treat skills as prompts or skip them entirely during installation.
  environments:
    claude:
      target: ".claude/skills/"
