# Bundled Subagents Directory
#
# This directory contains pre-defined subagents that ship with the dot-work package.
# Subagents can be installed via `dot-work install --env <env>`.
#
# Each subagent should be a markdown file with frontmatter.
#
# Example structure:
# code-reviewer.md
# architect.md
