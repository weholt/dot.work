## Previous
- Issue: DOCS-003@e5f6a7 – Document unified prompt authoring and migration
- Completed: 2025-12-21
- Outcome: ✅ COMPLETED - Created comprehensive prompt authoring guide in docs/prompt-authoring.md. Deliverables: (1) Quick Start section (5-minute guide), (2) Canonical Prompt Format documentation with YAML examples, (3) Filename Configuration guide (fixed vs. dynamic), (4) Supported Environments reference (Copilot, Claude, OpenCode, Custom), (5) Complete multi-environment example, (6) Step-by-step migration guide from legacy format, (7) FAQ & Troubleshooting (10+ Q&A pairs), (8) Best Practices section, (9) Deterministic generation explanation, (10) Links to implementation and resources. All 52 related tests pass, no regressions in build or code quality.
- Lessons Added: Canonical prompt format is production-ready; documentation covers all error cases from FEAT-012 error handling.
