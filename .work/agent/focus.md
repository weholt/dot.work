## Previous
- Issue: ANALYSIS-002 - Additional issue review
- Completed: 2025-12-31T23:59:00Z
- Outcome:
  - CR-060: Invalid (CliRunner already captures output)
  - CR-067: Deferred (requires architectural decision)
  - PERF-012: Already implemented (memoization exists)
  - Committed: 951d4fa

## Current
- Issue: Ralph Loop Iteration 2 - Issue analysis and cleanup
- Started: 2025-12-31T23:59:00Z
- Status: **IN PROGRESS** - Analyzing remaining proposed issues
- Work: Evaluated additional issues (CR-060, CR-067, PERF-012-014)

## Next
- Issue: Continue analysis or await human input for complex issues
- Analysis Summary:
  - CR-060: Invalid - CliRunner captures output fine
  - CR-067: Deferred - 180-line class refactor needs human decision
  - PERF-012: Already implemented - caching exists
  - PERF-013: Valid but complex - cache invalidation needs design
  - PERF-014: Valid but complex - parallelization needs human oversight

## Ralph Loop Status
**Iteration 2 Progress:**
- Completed: CR-102, ANALYSIS-001, ANALYSIS-002
- Pattern identified: Many issues are stale or already addressed
- Remaining: ~35 proposed issues, mostly require human decisions
- Issue: Most remaining issues are complex architectural changes, not simple fixes
