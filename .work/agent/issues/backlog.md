### Problem
After implementing skills and subagents, users will want to share their creations with the community. Currently there's no central way to discover, install, and update community-contributed skills and subagents.

### Proposed Solution
**User decision:** Defer to future enhancement. Will revisit when skills/subagents are stable and in use.

### Notes
Estimated effort: 20-40 days depending on scope. Git-based approach recommended for simplicity.
