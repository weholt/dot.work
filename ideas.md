# Ideas for further improvements

- in src/dot_work/prompts: make a global yaml frontmatter configuration available as default for the prompts in a file called src/dot_work/prompts/global.yml which is inserted into each prompt at run-time, but make it possible to override just in case of exceptions in local values in each prompt file
- rename all .prompt.md files to just .md
